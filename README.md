This is my PyTorch implementation for the paper:

> Neural Graph Collaborative Filtering. SIGIR 2019.


## Environment Requirement
The code has been run and tested under:
Python 3.8.13
pytorch == 1.4.0


## Example to Run the Codes
The argument can be see in the parser function in NGCF/main.py).
```
python main.py
